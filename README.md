NAME
====

**Rakudoc::Utils** - Provides a binary and routines to extract Rakudoc and convert to classes for further word processing.

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
$ rakudoc2wp <file with Rakudoc> ofile=/file/path
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Rakudoc::Utils** is designed to simplify extracting Rakudoc from a file and converting it to a user-friendly tree structure for further processing.

It is intended primarily to be used in PDF document production, but it could also be useful in other roles.

Note its initial release has only a limited capability in order to support my upcoming distribution **Slidemaker**. To do that, it must handle the following Rakudoc elements:

    Formatting codes: L, B, I, U, O, S
    Bare strings/paragraphs

    =Title
    =Subtitle
    =for para
    =item     # not numbered, level 1 only
    =begin/=end code/para/item/comment
    =comment
