=head1 NAME

B<RakuDoc::Utils> - Provides routines to extract RakuDoc and convert to classes for further word processing.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
use RakuDoc::Utils;
#...user code
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<RakuDoc::Utils> is designed to simplify extracting RakuDoc from a file
and converting it to a user-friendly tree structure for further processing.

It is intended primarily to be used in PDF document production, but it
could also be useful in other roles.

Note its initial release has only a limited capability in order to support
my upcoming distribution B<Slidemaker>. To do that, it must handle the following
RakuDoc elements:

=begin code
Formatting codes: C, L, B, I, U, O, M
Bare strings/paragraphs

=Title
=Subtitle
=for para
=item     # not numbered, level 1 only
=begin/=end code/para/item/comment
=comment
=end code

=head1 Classes

The following classes are designed to group data for the
user:

=head3 class PChunk
# list of all pieces for one slide (or page for other document types)
=begin code
class ChunksPhrase {
    has @.atoms;
}
=end code

=head3 class Vbloc
=begin code
class Vbloc {
    #| should only have one of the following
    #| (any text chunks may be formatted or contain links)
    has $.text; 
    has $.list;
    has $.title;
    has $.subtitle;
}
=end code
