See David's formatting code handling in Pod::To::PDF::Lite
(is an "atom" a chunk of formatted text? can I do that myself?)

Create tests for the following:

- text block with formatting codes
  and a link

- list of two items

- prologue config:
  (should be a real config for a "slide" type)

    title colors
    slide border
    slide number
